# Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy
In this project, I had to create an Excursion website on my own computer, and, when it was finised, deploy it with **Github Actions**.

Codecademy provided me a design spec and image assets to help me along the way. I had to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS grid, that the design spec indicated, with little guidance.
