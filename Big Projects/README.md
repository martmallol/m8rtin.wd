# Big Projects
What each project is about? Let's summarize it with an ordered list:
1. **Dasmoto**: It's an *Arts & Crafts* website. I followed a design spec image to build all the HTML and CSS of the page.
2. **Tea Cozy**: It's a *tea shop* website where I had to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS following a Design Spec image.
3. **Yelp Clone**: As its name indicates, is a *Yelp-like clone* called *Ravenous*. I had to create Static Components, pass information to Components, set the State of Ravenous Components, and finally, interact with the Yelp API.  
4. **Jammming**: It's a *Spotify-like* APP. It let's you search for a song and add it to your Playlist. It's built on React.
5. **Boss Machine**: It's a web page where you add *'million dollar ideas'*, *'minions'* and *meetings*. I built the entire API to serve information to the page. I created different API routes for every aspect of the page, working along the database aswell (this was provided beforehand).
6. **Gold Medal Metrics**: It's an Olympics analytics web app. I created all the SQL queries that power it.
7. **X-Press Publishing**: It's an internal management tool for a comic book publishing company. Here I built a complete API using Express.js and SQLite.
