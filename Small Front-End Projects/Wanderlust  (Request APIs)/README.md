## Que hice en este ejercicio

Trabaje solamente sobre el archivo **main.js**. Genere APIs de dos plataformas, **Foursquare** y **OpenWeather**. Con la primera pude conseguir data sobre locaciones geograficas. Mientras que la segunda me permitio obtener informacion sobre el clima en determinadas zonas. 

Con este ejercicio puse en practica conceptos nuevos como las **APIs**, el **Request** de estas, **async... await**, **promises**, **responses**, **fetch()**, **.then()**, convertir objetos a **JSON**, la dinamica **try & catch**, y mas.

## Indicaciones de Codecademy

Using fetch, async, and await, you’ll request information from the Foursquare API and OpenWeather API to create a travel website.

Before you begin, you’ll need to register for developer accounts for both of the APIs above. They’re both free.

For Foursquare, once you make an account, navigate to your Projects page, click Create New Project and give it a fitting name. Within your new project, select Generate API Key, which you’ll also need to name, then the Foursquare API will supply you with an API Key. You’ll need to save this key in main.js.

Note: You will only be able to see the Foursquare API Key once. Make sure you copy and paste it somewhere before dismissing the prompt. Should you ever lose your API key, be sure to revoke access to that key and generate a new one. All of these tasks can be completed from the Project Settings page.

For OpenWeather, follow the instructions for the How to start. When prompted, create your account, you can fill in other for the OpenWeather questions for their data collection. OpenWeather will give you an API Key, which you’ll also need to save in main.js.

Note: In this project, you will be using API Keys to authenticate the requests you make to the Foursquare and OpenWeather APIs. An API Key is your personal credential to access API resources and should never be shared. This means if you screenshot or send your code to someone for any reason, you should censor or remove your API Keys before doing so!

## BONUS!: What's Next?
If you want more practice, try any of the following challenges:

+ Fetch more than 4 places and randomize which ones are added to the page.

+ Include additional information about the weather.

+ Include additional information about each place from the response.

+ For a particularly difficult challenge, try fetching place photos! This will require an additional request for place photos for each place, as the photo information is not returned in the initial request.
