NAVIGATING THE FILE SYSTEM
INTRO TO COMMAND LINE: The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. You can use it to 
traverse and edit your computer’s filesystem. Through the command line, you can create new files, edit the 
contents of those files, delete files, and more! The advantage of using the command line is its power. You can run 
programs, write scripts to automate common tasks, and combine simple commands to handle difficult tasks.
On Mac and Linux systems, we access the command line through something called Bash. Although Windows comes with a 
different built-in command line, Windows users can also download Bash. 

FILESYSTEM: A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure:
1. The first directory in the filesystem is the **root directory.** It is the parent of all other directories and 
   files in the filesystem.
2. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.
3. Each directory can contain more files and child directories. The parent-child relationship continues as long as 
   directories and files are nested.
Filesystem example: https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-command-line/img/LCL-fileTrees-01.png

THE COMMAND 'ls': A command is a directive to the computer to perform a specific task. When you type ls, the 
command line looks at the directory you are in, and then “lists” all the files and directories inside of it.
In the terminal, the first thing you see is $. This is called a shell prompt. It appears when the terminal is 
ready to accept a command.
If we typed:
  $ ls

the terminal would display our current directory’s files and directories:
  2014  2015  hardware.txt

The directories 2014, 2015, and the file hardware.txt are the contents of the current directory.


THE COMMAND 'pwd': **pwd** stands for “print working directory.” It outputs the name of the directory you are 
currently in, called the working directory. Here is an example:
  $ pwd
  /home/ccuser/workspace/blog   (<-- this is what the console prints)


THE COMMAND 'cd': It stands for “change directory.” Just as you would click on a folder in Windows Explorer, cd 
switches you into the directory you specify. In other words, cd changes the working directory.
Let’s say the directory we change into is 2015:
  $ cd 2015

When a file, directory, or program is passed into a command, it is called an argument. Here the 2015 directory is an 
argument for the cd command. The cd command takes a directory name as an argument and switches into that directory.

Instead of using cd twice in order to move from 2015 to memory (/home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015/jan/memory), we 
can use it once and give it a longer argument:
  $ cd jan/memory

To move up one directory, we use cd ..: (esto me sirve para volver atras)
  $ cd ..
Here, cd .. navigates up from jan/memory/ to jan/.


THE COMMAND 'mkdir': Now that we can traverse the existing filesystem, let’s try editing it by making directories 
(folders) through the command line. The command for that is mkdir:
  $ mkdir media

The mkdir command stands for “make directory”. It takes in a directory name as an argument and then creates a new 
directory in the current working directory. Here we used mkdir to create a new directory named media/ inside our 
working directory.

We’ve made our new media directory, but what if we wanted to create another directory inside that one? We could 
make the new directory from our current position by using a / to combine arguments as we did in the last lesson.
Using:
  $ mkdir media/tv (crea las dos carpetas a la vez, o crea a la carpeta 'tv' si estoy en el directorio que 
		    contiene a 'media')


THE COMMAND 'touch': Now we know how to create directories through the command line, but how do we create new files?
We can do this using the command touch:
  $ touch keyboard.txt

The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument and then 
creates an empty file with that name in the current working directory.

HELPER COMMANDS: Let’s look at some helpful commands that will make using it easier!
THE COMMAND 'clear': clear is used to clear your terminal, which is useful when it’s full of previous commands and 
                     outputs. It doesn’t change or undo your previous commands, it just clears them from the view. 
                     You can scroll upwards to see them at any time.

THE 'tab' KEY: tab can be used to autocomplete your command. When you are typing the name of an existing file or 
               directory, you can use tab to finish the rest of the name.

THE 'up' AND 'down' ARROW KEYS: They can be used to cycle through your previous commands. ↑ will take you up 
                                through your most recent commands, and ↓ will take you back through to the most 
                                recent one.

RESUME: 
From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:
  - pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.
  - ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.
  - cd switches you into the directory you specify.
  - mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.
  - touch creates a new file inside the working directory.

You can use helper commands to make navigation easier:
  - clear clears the terminal
  - tab autocompletes the name of a file or directory
  - ↑ and ↓ allow you to cycle through previous commands
  

-----LECCION 2----- 
WHAT IS BASH?: Bash, or the Bourne-Again SHell, is a CLI that was created as a free software replacement for the 
Bourne Shell. A shell is a specific kind of CLI. Bash is “open source,” which means that anyone can read the code 
and suggest changes. 

BASH SETUP FOR WINDOWS: Windows has a CLI called Command Prompt. While this has many of the same features as Bash, 
Bash is much more popular. Because of the strength of the open source community and the tools they provide, 
mastering Bash is a better investment than mastering Command Prompt.

To use Bash on a Windows computer, we will download and install a program called Git Bash. Git Bash allows us to 
easily access Bash as well as another tool we’ll be using later called Git, inside the Windows environment.

MANIPULATION
ls, REVISITED: The 'ls' command lists all files and directories in the working directory. We can use ls as is, or 
attach an option. Options modify the behavior of commands. For example:
  ls -a

This command displays all the files and directories, including those starting with a dot (.). Files starting with 
a dot are normally hidden, and don’t appear when using ls alone.

In addition to -a, the ls command has several more options. Here are three common ones:
-a - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories
-l - lists all contents of a directory in long format, as well as the file permissions
-t - orders files and directories by the time they were last modified.
-alt - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, ordered by the date and time 
       they were last modified.

'cat' COMMAND: The cat command outputs the contents of a specified file. For example:
  cat action/superwoman.txt
will output all the text from superwoman.txt.

This is a useful command for peeking at files without opening them, and confirming the result of other commands 
that change the contents of files.

'cp' COMMAND: Let’s move on to copying, moving, and removing files and directories from the command line. The cp 
command copies files or directories. Below, we copy the contents of a source file into a destination file:
  cp source.txt destination.txt 

We could also copy a file to a destination directory:
  cp source.txt destination/

To copy multiple files into a directory, use cp with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the 
destination directory as the last argument. Here, we copy the files file1.txt and file2.txt into the same directory.
  cp file1.txt file2.txt my_directory/ 

WILDCARDS: In addition to using exact filenames as arguments, we can use special characters like * to select groups 
of files. These special characters are called wildcards. For example, here we use cp to copy all files in the 
current working directory into another directory.
  cp * my_directory/

In the next example, w*.txt selects all files in the working directory starting with “w” (prefix) and ending with 
“.txt” (suffix), and copies them to my_directory/.
  cp w*.txt my_directory/

'mv' COMMAND: This command moves files. mv moves a file without making a copy. To move a file into a directory, use 
mv with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument. 
Here we move my_file.txt into my_directory/.
  mv my_file.txt my_directory/

To move multiple files into a directory, use mv with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the 
destination directory as the last argument. 
Here, we move my_file_1.txt and my_file_2.txt into my_directory/.
  mv my_file_1.txt my_file_2.txt my_directory/

To rename a file, use mv with the old file as the first argument and the new file as the second argument. By moving 
file_original.txt into file_renamed.txt, we rename the file as file_renamed.txt.
  mv file_origin.txt file_renamed.txt

'rm' AND 'rm -r' COMMANDS: The rm command deletes files and directories. 
Here we remove the file unwanted_file.txt from the filesystem.
  rm unwanted_file.txt

The -r is an option that modifies the behavior of the rm command. The -r stands for “recursive,” and it’s used to 
delete a directory and all of its child directories. For example:
  rm -r unwanted_directory

Be careful when you use rm! It deletes files and directories permanently. There isn’t an undelete command, so once 
you delete a file or directory with rm, it’s gone.

REVIEW: 
1. Options modify the behavior of commands:
  - ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
  - ls -l lists all contents in long format
  - ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified
  - Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt

2. From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:
  - cp copies files
  - mv moves and renames files
  - rm removes files
  - rm -r removes directories

3. Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories
