ADVANCED REACT TECHNIQUES
How to make a propType, how to write a form, and how to use styles. Dividing components into presentational 
components and container components.

INLINE STYLES: An inline style is a style that’s written as an attribute, like this:
	<h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Hello world</h1>

Notice the double curly braces. What are those for?
The outer curly braces inject JavaScript into JSX. They say, “everything between us should be read as JavaScript, 
not JSX.” The inner curly braces create a JavaScript object literal. They make this a valid JavaScript object:
	{ color: 'red' }
	
MAKE A STYLE OBJECT VARIABLE: One problem with previous approach is that it becomes obnoxious if you want to use
more than just a few styles. An alternative that’s often nicer is to store a style object in a variable, and then
inject that variable into JSX.

const style = {
  color: 'darkcyan',
  background: 'mintcream'
};

Defining a variable named style in the top-level scope would be an extremely bad idea in many JavaScript 
environments! In React, however, it’s totally fine.
Every file is invisible to every other file, except for what you choose to expose via module.exports. You could 
have 100 different files, all with global variables named style, and there could be no conflicts.

STYLE NAME SYNTAX: In regular JavaScript, style names are written in hyphenated-lowercase:
const styles = {
  'margin-top': '20px',
  'background-color': 'green'
};

In React, those same names are instead written in camelCase:
const styles = {
  marginTop: '20px',
  backgroundColor: 'green'
};

SHARE STYLES ACROSS MULTIPLE COMPONENTS: One way to make styles reusable is to keep them in a separate JavaScript 
file. This file should export the styles that you want to reuse. You can then import your styles into any 
component that wants them.

SEPARATE CONTAINER COMPONENTS FROM PRESENTATIONAL COMPONENTS
It's a programming pattern that will help organize your React code.

CONTAINER COMPONENT: If a component has to have state, make calculations based on props, or manage any other 
complex logic, then that component shouldn’t also have to render HTML-like JSX. The functional part of a component 
(state, calculations, etc.) can be separated into a container component.

PRESENTATIONAL COMPONENT: The presentational component’s only job is to contain HTML-like JSX. It should be an 
exported component and will not render itself because a presentational component will always get rendered by a 
container component.

As a separate example, say we have Presentational and Container components. Presentational.js must export the 
component class (or function, when applicable):
	export class Presentational extends Component {
Container.js must import that component:
	import { Presentational } from 'Presentational.js';

EN RESUMEN:
- Container: Logic
- Presentational: JSX elements

propTypes FEATURE

propTypes are useful for two reasons. The first reason is prop validation.

Validation can ensure that your props are doing what they’re supposed to be doing. If props are missing, or if they’re present but they aren’t what you’re expecting, then a warning will print in the console.

This is useful, but reason #2 is arguably more useful: documentation.

Documenting props makes it easier to glance at a file and quickly understand the component class inside. When you have a lot of files, and you will, this can be a huge benefit.

APPLY propTypes: 
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; <-- ACA!!!

export class MessageDisplayer extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1>; <-- ACA!!!
  }
}

// This propTypes object should have one property for each expected prop:
MessageDisplayer.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string 		<-- ACA!!!
};


Notice the expression this.props.message. From this expression, you can deduce that MessageDisplayer expects to 
get passed a prop named message. Somewhere, at some time, this code is expected to execute:
	<MessageDisplayer message="something" />

If a component class expects a prop, then you can use propTypes for that component class! In order to start using 
propTypes, we need to import the 'prop-types' library. Then, you can declare propTypes as a static property for 
your component after the component has been defined. The second step is to add properties to the propTypes 
object. For each prop that your component class expects to receive, there can be one property on your propTypes 
object.

PropTypes PROPERTIES: What are the properties on propTypes supposed to be, exactly? The name of each property in 
propTypes should be the name of an expected prop. In our case, MessageDisplayer expects a prop named message, so 
our property’s name is message.

The value of each property in propTypes should fit this pattern:
	PropTypes.expected_data_type_goes_here

If you add .isRequired to a propType, then you will get a console warning if that prop isn’t sent.
	blabla.propTypes = {
	  week: PropTypes.number.isRequired
	}

REACT FORMS

INPUT onChange: A traditional form doesn’t update the server until a user hits “submit.” But you want to update 
the server any time a user enters or deletes any character.
	<input type="text" onChange={this.handleUserInput}/>

INPUT EVENT HANDLER: Define a function that gets called whenever a user enters or deletes any character.
export class Input extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { userInput: '' };
    this.handleUserInput = this.handleUserInput.bind(this); <-- ACA!!!
  }
  
  handleUserInput(e) {
    this.setState({userInput: e.target.value});	<-- ACA!!!
  }
  ...
}

INPUT'S INITIAL STATE: The initial text should be blank! Otherwise it would look like someone had already typed 
something.
  constructor(props) {
    ...
    this.state = { userInput: '' };	 <-- ACA!!!
  }
  
UPDATE AN INPUT'S VALUE: When a user types or deletes in the <input />, then that will trigger a change event, 
which will call 'handleUserInput'. 'handleUserInput' will set 'this.state.userInput' equal to whatever text is currently in the input field. 

You need to somehow make the <input />‘s text responsive to this.state.userInput. Easy enough! You can control an 
<input />‘s text by setting its value attribute: 
      <div>
        <input type="text" onChange={this.handleUserInput} value={this.state.userInput} />
        <h1>{this.state.userInput}</h1>
      </div>

COMPONENT LIFECYCLE METHODS
The component lifecycle has three high-level parts:

1- Mounting, when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time
2- Updating, when the component updates as a result of changed state or changed props
3- Unmounting, when the component is being removed from the DOM

Every React component you’ve ever interacted with does the first step at a minimum. If a component never mounted, 
you’d never see it!

Most interesting components are updated at some point. A purely static component—like, for example, a logo—might 
not ever update. But if a component’s state changes, it updates. Or if different props are passed to a component, 
it updates.

Finally, a component is unmounted when it’s removed from the DOM. For example, if you have a button that hides a 
component, chances are that component will be unmounted. If your app has multiple screens, it’s likely that each 
screen (and all of its child components) will be unmounted. 

Once a component instance is unmounted, that’s it—it will never be re-mounted, or updated again, or unmounted.

INTRODUCTION TO LIFECYCLE METHODS: You’ve already used two of the most common lifecycle methods: constructor() 
and render()! constructor() is the first method called during the mounting phase. render() is called later during 
the mounting phase, to render the component for the first time, and during the updating phase, to re-render the 
component.

Notice that lifecycle methods don’t necessarily correspond one-to-one with part of the lifecycle. constructor() 
only executes during the mounting phase, but render() executes during both the mounting and updating phase.

THE componentDidMount() METHOD: componentDidMount() is the final method called during the mounting phase. The order is:
1 - The constructor
2 - render()
3 - componentDidMount()
In other words, it’s called after the component is rendered. Este metodo sirve para encargarse, por ejemplo, de 
que un reloj actualice la hora cada 1 segundo todo el tiempo.

THE componentWillUnmount METHOD: Our clock is working, but it has an important problem. We never told the 
interval to stop, so it’ll keep running that function forever (or at least, until the user leaves/refreshes the 
page).

When the component is unmounted (in other words, removed from the page), that timer will keep on ticking, trying 
to update the state of a component that’s effectively gone. This means your users will have some JavaScript code 
running unnecessarily, which will hurt the performance of your app.

componentWillUnmount() is called in the unmounting phase, right before the component is completely destroyed. 
It’s a useful time to clean up any of your component’s mess.

In our case, we’ll use it to clean up the clock’s interval.

THE componentDidUpdate METHOD: Let’s look at the updating phase. When a component updates, it calls several 
methods, but only two are commonly used.

The first is render(), which we’ve seen in every React component. When a component’s props or state changes, 
render() is called.

The second, which we haven’t seen yet, is componentDidUpdate(). Just like componentDidMount() is a good place for 
mount-phase setup, componentDidUpdate() is a good place for update-phase work.
