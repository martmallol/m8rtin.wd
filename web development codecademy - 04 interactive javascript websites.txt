WEB DEVELOPMENT CODECADEMY:

-----LECCION 1----- 
THE <SCRIPT> TAG: The <script> element allows you to add JavaScript code inside an HTML file. 
Below, the <script> element embeds valid JavaScript code:

<h1>This is an embedded JS example</h1>
<script>
  function Hello() {
    alert ('Hello World');
  }
</script>

THE SRC ATTRIBUTE: Let’s talk about linking code.  Instead of having messy code that is all in the same file, 
developers separate their code into different files, making each “concern” easier to understand and more 
convenient when changes must be made.

Instead of writing JavaScript in our HTML file, we write it in its own file, and then reference this code with a 
file path name. We do this using the **src attribute**!

This seems familiar, that’s because you may have been linking to external files with the <img> and <link> elements. 
The attribute is exactly the same, but now its value specifies the location of your script file.

Below is an example of a providing a relative path for a JavaScript file.
<script src="./exampleScript.js"></script>

HOW ARE SCRIPTS LOADED?: Elements, including the <script> element, are by default, parsed in the order they appear 
in the HTML file. When the HTML parser encounters a <script> element, it loads the script then executes its 
contents before parsing the rest of the HTML. The two main points to note here are that:
- The HTML parser does NOT process the next element in the HTML file until it loads and executes the <script> 
  element, thus leading to a delay in load time and resulting in a poor user experience.
- Additionally, scripts are loaded sequentially, so if one script depends on another script, they should be placed 
  in that very order inside the HTML file.

Aca se habla basicamente sobre que al cargar una pagina, hay elementos que se cargan antes que otros. Los scripts 
se leen de arriba a abajo.

DEFER ATTRIBUTE: The defer attribute specifies scripts should be executed after the HTML file is completely parsed. 
When the HTML parser encounters a <script> element with the defer attribute, it loads the script but defers the 
actual execution of the JavaScript until after it finishes parsing the rest of the elements in the HTML file.

Here is an example of the defer tag:
<script src="example.js" defer></script> 

Q: When is defer useful?
A: When a script contains functionality that requires interaction with the DOM, the defer attribute is the way 
to go. This way, it ensures that the entire HTML file has been parsed before the script is executed.

ASYNC ATTRIBUTE: The async attribute loads and executes the script asynchronously with the rest of the webpage. 
This means that, similar to the defer attribute, the HTML parser will continue parsing the rest of the HTML as 
the script is downloaded in the background. However, with the async attribute, the script will not wait until 
the entire page is parsed: it will execute immediately after it has been downloaded. 

Here is an example of the async tag:
<script src="example.js" async></script>

Q: When is it useful?
A: async is useful for scripts that are independent of other scripts in order to function accordingly. Thus, if it 
does not matter exactly at which point the script file is executed, asynchronous loading is the most suitable 
option as it optimizes web page load time.

The old convention was to put scripts right before the </body> tag to prevent the script from blocking the rest 
of the HTML content. Now, the convention is to put the script tag in the <head> element and to use the 
defer and async attributes.


-----LECCION 2----- 
WHAT IS THE DOM?: The Document Object Model, abbreviated DOM, is a powerful tree-like structure that allows 
programmers to conceptualize hierarchy and access the elements on a web page.
The DOM is a language-agnostic structure implemented by browsers to allow for web scripting languages, 
like JavaScript, to access, modify, and update the structure of an HTML web page in an organized way.
For this reason, we like to think of the DOM as the link between an HTML web page and scripting languages.

Explicacion en español: El DOM es la estructura de objetos que genera el navegador cuando se carga un documento y 
se puede alterar mediante Javascript para cambiar dinámicamente los contenidos y aspecto de la página.

THE DOM AS A TREE STRUCTURE: Tree-like modeling is used in many fields, including evolutionary science and data 
analytics. The DOM tree follows similar logic to that of a family tree.
In the DOM tree, the top-most node is called the root node, and it represents the HTML document. The descendants 
of the root node are the HTML tags in the document, starting with the <html> tag followed by the <head> and <body> 
tags and so on.

NODES AND ELEMENTS IN THE DOM: There are nine different types of node objects in the DOM tree. In our diagram, the 
node objects with the sharp-edge rectangles are of the type Element, while the rounded edge rectangles are of type 
Text, because they represent the text inside the HTML paragraph elements.

When trying to modify a web page, the script will mostly interact with the DOM nodes of type element. Elements are 
the building units of HTML web pages, they contain everything between an opening tag and a closing tag. If the tag 
is a self-closing tag, then that is the element itself.

ATTRIBUTES OF AN ELEMENT NODE: The DOM also allows access to the regular attributes of an HTML element such as 
its style, id, etc.


-----LECCION 3----- 
THE DOCUMENT KEYWORD: The document object in JavaScript is the door to the DOM structure. The document allows you 
to access the root node of the DOM tree. Before you can access a specific element in the page, first you must 
access the document structure itself. The document allows scripts to access children of the DOM as properties.

For example, if you wanted to access the <body> element in your script, you could access it as a property of the 
document by typing document.body. This property will return the body element of that DOM.

A comprehensive list of all document properties: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document

TWEAK AN ELEMENT: When using the DOM in your script to access an HTML element, you also have access to all of that 
element’s properties. This includes the ability to modify the contents of the element as well as its attributes and 
properties— that can range from modifying the text inside a p element to assigning a new background color to a div.

You can access and set the contents of an element with the .innerHTML property.
For example, the following code reassigns the inner HTML of the body element to the text ‘The cat loves the dog’:
document.body.innerHTML = 'The cat loves the dog.';

The .innerHTML property can also add any valid HTML, including properly formatted elements. The following example 
assigns an h2 element as a child inside the <body> element:
document.body.innerHTML = '<h2>This is a heading</h2>'; 

SELECT AND MODIFY ELEMENTS: What if we wanted to select a specific element? The DOM interface allows us to access a
specific element with CSS selectors. CSS selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply, but we 
can also use these same selectors to access DOM elements with our script! Selectors can include the name of the 
tag, a class, or an ID.

The .querySelector() method allows us to specify a CSS selector and then returns the first element that matches 
that selector. The following code would return the first paragraph in the document.
document.querySelector('p');

You can also use other CSS selectors such as an element’s . class or its # ID.

Another option, if you want to access elements directly by their id, you can use the aptly named 
.getElementByID() function:
document.getElementById('bio').innerHTML = 'The description';

The example chains so that it selects the element with an ID of ‘bio’ and set its .innerHTML to the text 
‘The description’.

STYLE AND ELEMENT: Another way to modify an element is by changing its CSS style. The .style property of a DOM 
element provides access to the inline style of that HTML tag.
The syntax follows an element.style.property format, with the property representing a CSS property.

For example, the following code selects the first element with a class of blue and assigns blue as the 
background-color:
	let blueElement = document.querySelector('.blue');
	blueElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';

The following chaining syntax would also work:
	document.querySelector('.blue').style.fontFamily = 'Roboto';

CREATE AND INSERT ELEMENTS: Just as the DOM allows scripts to modify existing elements, it also allows for the 
creation of new ones. The .createElement(tagName) method creates a new element based on the specified tag name 
passed into it as an argument. However, it does not append it to the document. It creates an empty element with 
no inner HTML.

In order to create an element and add it to the web page, you must assign it to be the child of an element that 
already exists on the DOM. We call this process appending. The .appendChild() method will add a child element as 
the last child node.

The following code creates a new paragraph element, gives it an id, adds text to the new element’s .innerHTML, 
and appends it to the body of the document:
	let paragraph = document.createElement('p');
	paragraph.id = 'info'; 
	paragraph.innerHTML = 'The text inside the paragraph';
	document.body.appendChild(paragraph);

REMOVE AN ELEMENT: The DOM also allows for the removal of an element. The .removeChild() method removes a specified 
child from a parent.

Because the .querySelector() method returns the first paragraph, the following code would remove the first 
paragraph in the document:
	let paragraph = document.querySelector('p');
	document.body.removeChild(paragraph);

If you want to hide an element because it does not need to be loaded initially, the .hidden property allows you to 
hide it by assigning it as true or false:
	document.getElementById('sign').hidden = true;

INTERACTIVITY WITH ONCLICK: You can add interactivity to DOM elements by assigning a function to run based on an 
event. Events can include anything from a click to a user mousing over an element.

The .onclick property allows you to assign a function to run on a click event on an element:
	let element = document.getElementById('interact');
	element.onclick = function() { element.style.backgroundColor = 'blue' };

TRAVERSING THE DOM: Each DOM element node has a .parentNode and .children property. The property will return a 
list of the element’s children and return null if the element has no children. The .firstChild property will grant 
access to the first child of that parent element.
